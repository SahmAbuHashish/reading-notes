### What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

- The best piece of technical interview advice is to communicate.

The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss.

- Ask About Edge Cases
Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.
- Ask About Test Cases
Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass
- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
- Stuck? Ask for Help!
 it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally

### From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

- Come prepared.
When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.

- Review your work.
You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible. This is reasonable,
Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.

### What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

- the technical interviews should assess a candidate's problem-solving skills and intelligence.

- The interview questions should be challenging and centered around problem-solving rather than relying on obscure knowledge or trick questions. This approach helps evaluate a candidate's ability to handle difficult problems effectively.

- spend a few weeks preparing for interviews, focusing on gaining comfort with fundamental data structures and algorithms.

- Companies should prioritize a candidate's overall attributes instead of seeking a unanimous decision from all interviewers. Each interviewer should assess candidates based on specific attributes they are evaluating, leading to a more balanced hiring decision process.
