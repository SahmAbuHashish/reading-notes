## Reading Questions

### What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular Python libraries used for data visualization.
these libraries are not mutually exclusive, and you can combine them to take advantage of their individual strengths. For example, you can use Seaborn to create informative statistical plots and then enhance them with interactivity using Bokeh. 

1. Matplotlib:
   - Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a wide range of functionalities for creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations.
   - It offers a low-level interface that allows fine-grained control over plot elements.
   - Matplotlib is suitable for a wide range of visualizations, from simple line plots to complex figures with multiple subplots.
   - It is widely used for scientific and statistical plotting, data exploration, and creating custom visualizations.
   - Example: A line plot showing the trend of a stock price over time is a suitable visualization for Matplotlib.

2. Seaborn:
   - Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
   - It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations by providing default styles and color palettes.
   - Seaborn focuses on visualizing statistical relationships and supports specialized plots such as violin plots, box plots, and joint plots.
   - It is particularly useful for exploring and visualizing relationships between variables in datasets.
   - Example: A scatter plot with a linear regression line and confidence intervals to show the relationship between two variables would be suitable for Seaborn.

3. Bokeh:
   - Bokeh is a powerful library for creating interactive visualizations and data applications for the web.
   - It emphasizes interactivity and allows users to create interactive plots, dashboards, and applications that can be displayed in web browsers.
   - Bokeh supports a wide range of plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and geographical plots.
   - It is well-suited for creating interactive visualizations that require tools like hover tooltips, zooming, panning, and selection.
   - Example: An interactive map that allows users to explore different data points and access additional information by hovering over them would be a suitable visualization for Bokeh.

### In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

In Seaborn, there are several main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots.

1. Relational plots:
   - Relational plots in Seaborn are used to visualize the relationship between two or more variables. The main functions for creating relational plots are `scatterplot()`, `lineplot()`, and `relplot()`.

   - `scatterplot()` creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between two numeric variables. It is useful for identifying patterns, correlations, or clusters in the data.

   - `lineplot()` creates a line plot showing the relationship between two numeric variables over a continuous or categorical variable. It is suitable for visualizing trends or changes over time or other ordered variables.

   - `relplot()` is a flexible function that allows creating different types of relational plots, including scatter plots, line plots, and more. It provides a high-level interface to create a grid of subplots based on different variables or conditions.
   - Example use case: Visualizing the relationship between a car's horsepower and its fuel efficiency using a scatter plot created with `scatterplot()`.

2. Categorical plots:
   - Categorical plots in Seaborn are used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables or the relationship between categorical and numeric variables. The main functions for creating categorical plots are `barplot()`, `countplot()`, `boxplot()`, `violinplot()`, and `catplot()`.
   - `barplot()` creates a bar plot to show the mean or another statistical estimate for a categorical variable. It is useful for comparing the values of different categories.
   - `countplot()` creates a bar plot to show the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable. It is useful for visualizing the frequency distribution of categorical data.
   - `boxplot()` creates a box plot to show the distribution of a numeric variable for different categories. It helps visualize the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the data.
   - `violinplot()` creates a violin plot that combines a box plot with a kernel density estimation to show the distribution of a numeric variable for different categories.
   - `catplot()` is a flexible function that allows creating different types of categorical plots, including bar plots, count plots, box plots, violin plots, and more. It provides a high-level interface to create a grid of subplots based on different variables or conditions.
   - Example use case: Visualizing the distribution of students' grades in different subjects using a box plot created with `boxplot()`.

3. Distribution plots:
   - Distribution plots in Seaborn are used to visualize the distribution of a single variable. The main functions for creating distribution plots are `histplot()`, `kdeplot()`, and `distplot()`.
   - `histplot()` creates a histogram to show the distribution of a numeric variable. It represents the frequency or count of observations falling into different bins or intervals.
   - `kdeplot()` creates a kernel density plot to estimate the probability density function of a numeric variable. It shows the shape of the distribution without requiring predefined bins.
   - `distplot()` is a versatile function that can create both a histogram and a kernel density plot. It provides a flexible way to visualize the distribution of a single variable.
   - Example use case: Visualizing the distribution of ages in a population using a histogram created with `histplot()`.
