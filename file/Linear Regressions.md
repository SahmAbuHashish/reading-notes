# Readings: Linear Regressions

## Reading Questions

### Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Regression searches for relationships among variables. For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The purpose of linear regression in the context of machine learning and data analysis is to understand and predict the relationship between variables.

Linear regression can be used for both simple and multiple regression. Simple linear regression involves one independent variable, while multiple regression involves more than one independent variable.

### Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

1. Import the packages and classes that you need.
2. Provide data to work with, and eventually do appropriate transformations.
3. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
4. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
5. Apply the model for predictions.

### What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

we can't train that model on a single dataset or even we train it on a single dataset then we will not be able to assess the performance of our model. For that reason, we split our source data into training, testing, and validation datasets.
