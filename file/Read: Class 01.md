## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

## Names and Values in Python

Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

mutable values 
when you have a mutable value like list that has a method in them that let you change the value in place that means you have one list object witch changes its value 
- more than one name 
- the value changes 
- all names see the change 

immutable values can't alias like ints, floats, strings, tuples
that can't change the value in place so thy have no method on them that let you change that value
